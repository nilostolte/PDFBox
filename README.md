# PDFBox
This project offers several versions of [PDFBox](https://pdfbox.apache.org) source code that can be compiled with Eclipse. The complete version is a complete unmodified PDFBox with all packages normally not included in PDFBox source code. The other versions are modified versions offering more capabilities and generally for more specific uses.

The Apache PDFBox library is an open source Java tool for working with PDF documents. This project allows creation of new PDF documents, manipulation of existing documents and the ability to extract content from documents. Apache PDFBox also includes several command-line utilities.

The advantage of these repositories is that no building software is necessary. One can compile it using Eclipse for Java, for example.
